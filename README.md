**Multi-LMentry** is a multilingual extension of **LMentry (Efrat et al., 2023)**, which evaluates LLMs on tasks that are trivial for humans but often challenging for models. It covers nine languages:

- Catalan - *code:* ca
- Spanish - *code:* es
- German - *code:* de
- Basque - *code:* eu
- Galician - *code:* gl
- Korean - *code:* ko
- Italian - *code:* it
- Brazilian Portuguese - *code:* pt_br
- English (original LMentry dataset) - *code:* en

The dataset enables systematic evaluation of core model abilities across low-, mid-, and high-resource languages. Tasks were recreated manually with the help of native speakers, ensuring linguistic and cultural appropriateness rather than relying on direct translation.


## 🛠️ Installation

Installation from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langtech-bsc/multi_lmentry.git
cd multi_lmentry
conda create -n multi_lmentry python==3.12
conda activate multi_lmentry
pip install -e .
pip install flash-attn
```

## Model Generation 

To generate predictions over the Multi-LMentry benchmark you can execute:

```python
python lmentry/predict.py \
    --lang "lang_id" \
    --model_name "model_name_1" \
    --use_vll \
    --max_new_tokens "xx" \
    --batch_size "xx"
```

The `execute_generation.py` script will save results under `evaluation` folder.

Parameters:

- The `lang` parameter should be one of the available lang identificators.

- The `model_name` parameter should a model's name, defined in the `lmentry/models.py` file. To add a new model you have to define there one name, using the following template.

- The `use_vllm` parameter is a boolean flag, needed to activate the vllm engine instead of the default HF generation pipeline.

- The `max_new_tokens` parameter is the maximum number of tokens to generate for each sample, default is `1024`.

- The `max_new_tokens` parameter is the number of sample to process in a single batch, default is `8`. It is not used when `use_vllm` is set.

```python
paper_models = {
    "model_name" : {"short_name": "short name of a model", "paper_name": "huggingface name", "predictor_name": "huggingface name"},
    ...
}
```

## Model Evaluation

Once you have generated all the predictions, you have to evaluate the outputs using the scorers functions:

```python
python lmentry/evaluate.py \
    --lang "lang_id" \
    --num_proc "xx"
```

The `execute_eval.py` script will save overwrite the files under `evaluation` folder, and then it will create summary statistics under `results` folder.

Parameters:

- The `lang` parameter should be one of the available lang identificators.

- The `num_proc` parameter should a strictly positive integer.

## Data Creation

All annotated resources for the nine languages used to build the samples in the Multi-LMentry benchmark are located in the `resources` folder.

The Multi-LMentry benchmark can be reconstructed from these annotated resources to reproduce the same data as the version uploaded to Hugging Face.

```python
python recreate_tasks.py
```

We release all the created data under <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/BSC-LT/multi_lmentry">huggingface repository</a>.

    abstract = "As large language models (LLMs) continue to improve, their evaluation increasingly centers on complex, high-level tasks, often at the expense of systematically assessing fundamental capabilities. To address this gap, recent work proposed LMentry, a compact benchmark comprising tasks that are trivial for humans but remain surprisingly difficult for LLMs. However, LMentry is limited to English, leaving its insights linguistically narrow. In this paper, we present Multi-LMentry, a ground-up recreation of LMentry that enables systematic evaluation of LLMs on basic reasoning and understanding tasks across nine diverse languages. Multi-LMentry includes English and expands to Basque, Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Galician, German, Italian, Korean, and Spanish, emphasizing the importance of cross-lingual and low-resource settings. To validate that Multi-LMentry is still trivial for humans, we demonstrate that L2 speakers with only elementary proficiency achieve near-perfect scores in a low-resource language, namely, Basque. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that state-of-the-art open-weight multilingual LLMs still fall short of human performance on elementary tasks in many languages. Our results expose new failure modes that remain hidden in monolingual evaluation, underscoring the need for rigorous, language-diverse ``unit tests'' of core model abilities."
